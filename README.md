# ktv - Command-Line A<ins>ct</ins>i<ins>v</ins>ity Tracker
A (relatively) simple script to track what program i'm using in various time blocks, to try and shame myself into actually doing work.

Documentation TBD.

i would like to make this into a GUI program at some point, but that'd probably be even more procrastination than this script was.
